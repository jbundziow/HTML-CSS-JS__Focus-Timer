# HTML/CSS/JS \_\_ Focus timer

## Description

Web app in HTML/CSS/Javascript that counts the time spent focusing on something (e.g., programming, learning, reading etc.). This is my first project in life that includes Javascript :)

## How to use?

App can be used in two different modes:

### Auto mode

User clicks "Start" and app saves the current time. It's also displayed on screen with "Elapsed time" counted in real time. When the activity ends, user clicks "Stop". Time is recorded in the table with addidional informations like: start time, end time, optional comment.

The sum of minutes in the table is converted to hours and displayed in "Total elapsed time".
